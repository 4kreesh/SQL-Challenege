# SQL-Challenege

I have created a new data base SQL_challenge_updated, new tables created with appropritae column length. 
Executed and verified all the queries to check for proper execution. 
I have added the screenshot of the Postgres Page to show the newly created tables and queries execution. 
All the updated work is in the folder named "updated" for your verification.
